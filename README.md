This is the code for my personal website. It is hosted using the following technologies:

 - [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
 - [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) - which is built right into github pages. It uses the [jackal](https://github.com/clenemt/jackal) theme.

...as well as some personal tweaking. Thanks for checking it out! I suppose if you wanted to run this site locally you could do something like [this](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/).
